          Site and our Services (including to remember your actions and preferences), to run
          analytics and better understand user interaction with the Services (in our legitimate
          interests to administer, improve and optimize the Services). We may also permit third

          some of the Services, including certain features and general functionality, to work
          incorrectly or no longer be available. Additionally, blocking Cookies may not completely
          prevent how we share information with third parties such as our advertising partners.

          Our Site may provide links to websites or other online platforms operated by third
          parties. If you follow links to sites not affiliated or controlled by us, you should

          you provide on public or semi-public venues, including information you share on

          Services and/or users of those third-party platforms without limitation as to its use by
          us or by a third party. Our inclusion of such links does not, by itself, imply any
          endorsement of the content on such platforms or of their owners or operators, except as
          disclosed on the Services.

          individuals under 16 years of age.

        <h2 className="text-xl text-blue-600">Security and Retention of Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot
          guarantee "perfect security." In addition, any information you send to us may not be
          secure while in transit. We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to communicate
          sensitive or confidential information to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          How long we retain your personal information depends on different factors, such as whether
          we need the information to maintain your account, to provide the Services, comply with
          legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce other applicable contracts and policies.
